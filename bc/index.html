                  This is Boson Chang — an adventurer, a thinker, a curious soul, and maybe a gamer. This website was created while he was
                  sick at home with nothing else to do, so he thought a masked picture would suit the mood.

                  -Chang, at the
                  time of writing this.</i>

                  He hated all readings and liberal arts when he was younger. Cursed by his "intelligence," he chained himself to the
                  mindset that STEM development was the only contribution to the world. Now, it is believed that he has learned his
                  lessons and has discovered the beauty in the world.

                <p>He might be a funny person (maybe not), depending on who you are. He's getting there. He is not good at talking to
                females (obviously because he is a STEM boy). He gets addicted to whatever is in front of him and stays addicted until
                reaching his goal.</p>

                <p>As this picture suggests, he has a really strong adaptability. This ability helped him with traveling and going to a
                school with barely anything fun around. His insane addiction and self-control (only when needed) aid his success in many
                fields of study.</p>

                <hr><br>
                <p>His hairstyle is like a lottery—I believe that’s the case for most people out there as well. Bad communication skills
                with the barber caused the instability and inconsistency in his hairstyle. It is never too terrible, though. Who took
                this picture, you might ask? It was one of my best friends. Not having a lot of friends, I value all of my friendships
                greatly. Although I barely reach out actively to most of them most of the time, I still love them from the bottom of my
                heart. The lack of socializing was not caused by anything—I just became better at enjoying solitude (a bit too much,
                though). Solitude provides me time to appreciate my surroundings and rethink the purpose of life. The purpose of life is
                definitely not what I say when playing video games.</p>

                <p>Sometimes I sound or act like I don't care. I apologize for not being able to control my mouth
                and attitude—but I do care.</p>
