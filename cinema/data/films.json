    "description": "For my Film 102 homework, I was inspired by the convenience store setting in the award-winning short film O.C.D. I saw it as a great opportunity to overcome my fear of reaching out to external resources. Communicating with both the actor and the shop owner went surprisingly well. The biggest limitation I faced during the project was time—we had only about an hour each time we visited the location. Since we had to start over with the setup on each visit, we were only able to produce one shot per session. Despite these constraints, I learned how to be efficient with both time and budget. --Special thanks to Stony Asian Market"
